//mysql database is corrupted
-> start mysql command line
$mysql --user=root --password <database>
-can also drop the <database> part and just use
-find pass in /backup/goliathconfig..
>USE <database>
 once in mysql command line
-> REPAIR TABLE <table>;
-don't forget the ;. It's frustrating if you forget that.
